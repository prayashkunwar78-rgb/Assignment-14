# JavaScript Scopes and Closures

This project is created to understand the basic concepts of JavaScript scopes and closures.
It explains how variables behave in global, function, and block scopes, how JavaScript follows the scope chain, and how variable shadowing works.
The project also demonstrates closures by showing how inner functions can access outer function variables, how counters work using closures,
how data privacy can be achieved, and how closures behave inside loops.
The code is written in a simple and easy way using JavaScript and tested using a basic HTML file and browser console.
